#Descriptive contents 
##(functionality / features):
• The purpose of this website is to introduce myself to potential employers, as well as have an identifiable place for me to share projects and work history. I also intend on updating this and changing elements throughout the course, as I gain new skills and the ability to implement them.

• The functionality is simplistic with a few responsive elements, such as:

1) A navbar with a responsive inverse color effect when hovering over. Applies across all pages. 

2) A grayscaled photo on the title page that reverts to full colour upon hovering, and also acts as a link to the bio page. Scaled to fit desktops, tablets and phones.

3) Hyperlinks to social media pages (Twitter, LinkedIn and GitHub) representedn by small vectors of each site logo. Images feature a white background upon hovering.

4) A scrollable text element on the biography page, applies across all devices. Also changes colour to peach upon hovering. Scaled to fit desktop, tablets and phones.

5) On the biography page, when scaled to tablet and mobile versions, the image is on top and the text is on bottom. On desktop, text is left and image is right.

(I also considered using a similar effect for the black and white photo featured on the bio page as with front page photo, but decided against it as the grayscaled version of the color photo looked less aesthetically pleasing - the colour version of that photo is still in the file repository)

6) Another scrollable text element on the on the portfolio page, also changes colour to peach upon hovering. Scaled to fit tablets desktops, and phones.

7) A scrollable element on the blog page featuring photos and text, 5 posts in total compiling topics about music, nature and travel. Scaled to fit desktops, tablets and phones. On desktops, text is left and image is right. On tablets and phones, images are top and text is bottom.

8) Contact form on the contact page featuring 4 text fields (3 are inputs and one is text area), there are prompts for name, organisation, e-mail and comments. Scaled to fit desktops, phones and tablets.

#Target Audience
Ideally, it would be people who would like to employ me or use my services in the near future. So, this website is mainly intended for those wishing to hire me or, alternatively collaborate on a project. I am hoping to use this website as a springboard or reference of my capabilities, and logging of future work history.

#Tech Stack
The project in its current form features 5 pages of HTML and 1 page of CSS, as well as 10 featured images (3 vectors, 7 personal photos).
The deployment platform is Netlify.
